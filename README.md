# Project-2


Brief Articulation:  Our chosen topic for visualization will be recorded meteorite landings in the USA.  This data is available via NASA's website.

"Space Force has tasked our team with visualizing the meteorite landing data in order to both examine how best to protect Americans from meteorites.  Space Force is also interested in the different types of meteorite classes that fall most frequently in the United States; there is potential that we could reclaim precious metals from the fallen asteroids after study."
